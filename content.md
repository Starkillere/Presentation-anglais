- *[Pause for audience vote & discuss results]*"

---

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Question to Kiara (Astrophysics Expert)**  
- "Kiara, Raj is an astrophysicist who studies black holes. How accurate is his research?"

---

### **Specialist 3 (Kiara, Astrophysics Expert)**  
**Astrophysics in the Show**  
- *[Slide 6: Astrophysics in the Show]*  
- "Raj’s research on black holes is based on real astrophysics, though the show often simplifies the complexities of such studies. Black holes are a fascinating and complex topic, and the show does a decent job of introducing them to the audience."

---

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**  
**Expert Debate**  
- "Now, let’s make this more engaging! We’re going to dive into a heated debate about how accurately *The Big Bang Theory* represents science and scientists. Each of you will share your personal perspective, and don’t hold back—this is where things get intense!"  

- "Anrezki, let’s start with you. Do you think the show does a good job of representing physicists, or does it rely too much on stereotypes?"  

---

### **Specialist 1 (Anrezki, Physics Expert)**  
**Physics Representation**  
- *[Passionately]*  
- "As a physicist, I have mixed feelings. On one hand, the show introduces complex concepts like string theory and quantum mechanics in a way that’s accessible to the public. That’s great! But on the other hand, it often reduces physicists to caricatures—socially awkward, obsessive, and out of touch with reality. That’s not fair to the diverse and dynamic community of scientists I know."  

- *[Turning to Yacine]*  
- "Yacine, what about engineers? Howard is portrayed as a womanizer who somehow still works at NASA. Does that resonate with your experience?"  

---

### **Specialist 2 (Yacine, Aerospace Engineering Expert)**  
**Engineering Representation**  
- *[Firmly]*  
- "Absolutely not! Howard’s character is entertaining, but it’s a slap in the face to real engineers. Aerospace engineering is about precision, teamwork, and innovation—not just chasing women and making cheesy jokes. The show misses the mark by focusing on stereotypes instead of the real challenges and achievements of engineers."  

- *[Pointing at Kiara]*  
- "Kiara, you’re an astrophysicist. What’s your take on Raj’s portrayal? Is it fair to depict him as someone who can’t even speak to women without alcohol?"  

---

### **Specialist 3 (Kiara, Astrophysics Expert)**  
**Astrophysics Representation**  
- *[With frustration]*  
- "Raj’s character is problematic. While his research on black holes is somewhat accurate, his social anxiety is exaggerated to the point of being offensive. It perpetuates the idea that scientists are incapable of normal social interactions. In reality, astrophysicists are just as diverse and socially competent as anyone else."  

- *[Turning to Oriol]*  
- "Oriol, you’re the neuroscientist here. What about Amy? She’s portrayed as robotic and emotionless. Is that how neuroscientists are in real life?"  

---

### **Specialist 4 (Oriol, Neuroscience Expert)**  
**Neuroscience Representation**  
- *[With a raised voice]*  
- "Amy’s character is a disaster! Neuroscientists are passionate, creative, and deeply human. Reducing her to a cold, unfeeling robot is not only inaccurate but also harmful. It reinforces the stereotype that scientists lack emotions, which couldn’t be further from the truth."  

- *[Looking at Mathilde]*  
- "Mathilde, you’re the communication expert. What’s your take on how the show balances humor and science? Does it cross the line into disrespect?"  

---

### **Specialist 5 (Mathilde, Communication Expert)**  
**Science Communication**  
- *[Calmly but firmly]*  
- "The show walks a fine line. On one hand, it uses humor to make science relatable, which is fantastic for engaging the public. But on the other hand, it often sacrifices accuracy and respect for laughs. The constant mockery of scientists’ social skills and personalities can alienate real scientists and discourage young people from pursuing STEM careers."  

- *[To the audience]*  
- "What do you think? Is the humor in *The Big Bang Theory* harmless fun, or does it cross the line into disrespect? Let’s hear your thoughts!"  

---

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Public Reaction**  
- *[Encouraging audience participation]*  
- "Raise your hand if you think the show’s humor is harmless. Now, raise your hand if you think it’s disrespectful to scientists. *[Pause for audience responses]*"  

- "Interesting! It seems like opinions are divided. Let’s hear from our experts one last time. Anrezki, as a physicist, do you think the show’s impact on public perception of science is positive or negative?"  

---

### **Specialist 1 (Anrezki, Physics Expert)**  
**Final Thoughts**  
- *[With conviction]*  
- "It’s a double-edged sword. The show has brought science into mainstream culture, which is a good thing. But it’s also reinforced harmful stereotypes that we’re still trying to overcome. If the show had balanced humor with more accurate and respectful portrayals, it could have been a true force for good."  

---

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**  
**Wrap-Up**  
- "Thank you all for this passionate debate! It’s clear that *The Big Bang Theory* has sparked a lot of strong feelings—both positive and negative. Let’s take a moment to reflect on what we’ve learned today."  

---

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Conclusion**  
- "To wrap up, *The Big Bang Theory* is a show that blends science and humor in a way that’s both entertaining and controversial. While it has brought science into the spotlight, it’s also raised important questions about how scientists are portrayed in the media. Let’s keep this conversation going and work towards a future where science is both respected and celebrated."
