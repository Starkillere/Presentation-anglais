## Script for *WALL-E* Presentation (Revised)

---

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**:  
**Introduction**  
- *[Smile, facing the audience]*  
- "Good morning everyone! Today, we’re going to explore the fascinating world of *WALL-E*, a movie that delves into the future of Earth, humanity, and technology. We’ll take a closer look at how this animated movie blends science and fiction. But first, let’s start with a quick summary of the film."

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**:  
**Film Summary**  
- *[Slide 1: Movie Title, Release Date, Director]*  
- "Released in 2008, *WALL-E* is an animated science fiction film directed by Andrew Stanton. The story takes place in a distant future where Earth has been abandoned by humanity due to pollution and overconsumption. WALL-E, a small waste-collecting robot, is left behind to clean up the mess. He spends his days collecting trash and living alone, until one day, he discovers EVE, a robot sent to Earth to find signs of life. Together, they embark on a journey that could save the planet and the future of humanity."

- *[Slide 2: Main Characters and Key Roles]*  
- "The main characters are WALL-E, the waste-collecting robot, EVE, the scout robot, and the humans aboard the spaceship Axiom. The film touches on deep environmental issues and raises questions about technology’s role in our future."

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**:  
**Transition to Science vs Fiction**  
- "Now that we have a general idea of the plot, let’s explore how the movie blends science with fiction. We’ll dive into the technologies presented in *WALL-E*, and how they compare to what we know today. But first, let’s hear from you, the audience. Do you think the future of Earth could look like the one in *WALL-E*? Raise your hand if you think it's possible. *[Pause for responses]*"

### **Specialist 1 (Anrezki, Robotics and AI Expert)**:  
**Robotics and AI**  
- *[Slide 3: Robots in *WALL-E* - WALL-E and EVE]*  
- "Let’s start with robotics. *WALL-E* and EVE represent highly advanced forms of artificial intelligence. In the movie, they display emotions, make independent decisions, and interact with humans in a way that feels almost real. But how realistic is this?  
- *WALL-E*’s ability to navigate the Earth and carry out complex tasks, like sorting waste and interacting with EVE, is something we can only dream of today. While we have autonomous robots like vacuum cleaners, we’re far from achieving robots with the emotional intelligence shown in *WALL-E*."  
- *[Slide 4: Real-Life Robotics Advances]*  
- "Currently, AI in robotics is progressing, but it’s still limited to very specific tasks. For example, Boston Dynamics creates robots like Spot, who can walk and carry out basic tasks, but they don’t have the capability to understand and respond emotionally like WALL-E. So, while *WALL-E*'s technology is fictional, it raises interesting possibilities about the future of AI."

### **Specialist 2 (Kiara, Environmental Science Expert)**:  
**Ecology and Environmental Impact**  
- *[Slide 5: Earth in *WALL-E* - A Polluted Wasteland]*  
- "Now, let’s talk about the Earth in *WALL-E*. The movie depicts a planet overwhelmed by pollution and waste, leading to humanity abandoning it. This is a highly exaggerated scenario, but the movie addresses real-world issues. We’re already seeing the effects of pollution, deforestation, and waste accumulation today.  
- *[Slide 6: Real-World Environmental Problems]*  
- "In reality, while we aren’t at the level shown in the film, pollution and waste management are critical global issues. If we continue at our current pace, Earth could face severe environmental consequences. However, it’s important to note that humanity hasn’t completely given up on the planet. Efforts in sustainability and recycling, such as zero-waste initiatives and environmental policies, are pushing for change."

### **Specialist 3 (Yacine, Space Exploration Expert)**:  
**Space Exploration and Human Survival**  
- *[Slide 7: The Axiom Ship and Human Survival]*  
- "In the film, humanity abandons Earth and survives aboard the Axiom, a massive spaceship. While this seems far-fetched, space exploration is an ongoing scientific endeavor. But could we really live in space for centuries?  
- *[Slide 8: Current Space Exploration Efforts]*  
- "NASA and private companies like SpaceX are working on technology for long-term space travel. However, living in space permanently poses significant challenges, such as the effects of zero gravity, radiation exposure, and how to provide sustainable resources like food and water. While *WALL-E*’s vision is fictional, space travel is something humanity is seriously considering for the future."

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**:  
**Public Interaction - Question Time**  
- "Now, let’s pause and ask you again—do you think it’s possible for humanity to completely abandon Earth and live in space? What are your thoughts on this? *[Pause for audience answers]*  
- "Interesting points! It seems like there’s a mix of optimism and skepticism. Now, we’ll turn to our experts for further insights."

---

### **Specialist 1 (Anrezki)**:  
**Robotic Abilities in *WALL-E* and Reality**  
- *[Slide 9: Robotics and Emotional Intelligence]*  
- "As I mentioned earlier, the robots in *WALL-E* are capable of showing emotions and thinking independently. While this is far from current technology, the idea of creating robots with advanced emotional intelligence isn’t entirely out of reach. Researchers in AI and robotics are experimenting with machines that can recognize and respond to human emotions. However, the emotional complexity seen in *WALL-E* is still a work of science fiction."

### **Specialist 2 (Kiara)**:  
**Ecology - Can Earth Be Rehabilitated?**  
- *[Slide 10: Real-World Solutions to Pollution]*  
- "The film’s depiction of a completely abandoned Earth is fictional, but the environmental message is important. In the real world, we have the potential to prevent such a future. While it may take decades, efforts like reducing carbon emissions, cleaning oceans, and recycling can help reverse the damage. The key is to act now before it’s too late."

---

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**:  
**Conclusion and Transition to Quiz**  
- "So, in conclusion, *WALL-E* brings a very imaginative and dystopian vision of the future, blending science with fiction. The technological advancements shown in the film, like AI robots and space colonies, are still far beyond our current reach, but they spark conversations about the future. It challenges us to think about our planet, our technologies, and the potential consequences of our actions."

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**:  
**Quiz Time!**  
- *[Slide 11: Quiz]*  
- "Before we wrap up, let’s have a quick quiz to test your knowledge about *WALL-E* and the science behind it. *[Start quiz with 4-5 questions]*"

---

**End of Presentation**  
- "Thank you all for your attention! We hope you enjoyed the presentation. Don’t forget to think about the real-world implications of the fictional elements we discussed today. Have a great day!"

## Notes for the Presentation:
- Ensure each expert stays within their field of expertise to maintain clarity.
- Use visuals and key phrases in slides for better audience engagement.
- Interactive moments (questions to the public) should be spaced to maintain attention.
- The quiz at the end will help solidify the key takeaways.
