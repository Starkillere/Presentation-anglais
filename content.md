---

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Introduction**  
- *[Smile, facing the audience]*  
- "Good morning everyone! Today, we’re going to discuss *Don't Look Up*, a satirical film that critiques how society and the media respond to global crises, particularly climate change. Before diving in, let’s start with a brief summary of the movie."

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**  
**Film Summary**  
- *[Slide 1: Movie Title, Release Date, Director]*  
- "Released in 2021 and directed by Adam McKay, *Don't Look Up* follows two astronomers who discover a comet headed toward Earth. As they try to warn the world, they face political indifference, media sensationalism, and corporate greed. The film is a metaphor for the climate crisis and how governments and institutions often fail to act in time."

- *[Slide 2: Main Characters and Key Roles]*  
- "The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as the scientists, with Meryl Streep as the president and Jonah Hill as her chief of staff. It highlights how real scientific warnings are often ignored in favor of political and economic interests."

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Public Interaction**  
- "Now, before we move forward, let’s hear from you! Raise your hand if you think governments and media react appropriately to environmental crises. *[Pause for audience responses]*"  
- "Interesting! Let’s now explore the scientific themes of the film."

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**  
**Question to Anrezki (Astronomy Expert)**  
- "Anrezki, in the movie, scientists discover a comet and struggle to make politicians and the public take them seriously. How does this compare to real-life scientific communication on climate change?"

---

### **Specialist 1 (Anrezki, Astronomy & Climate Science Expert)**  
**Science Communication & Public Reaction**  
- *[Slide 3: Scientists in the Movie vs. Real Life]*  
- "In real life, scientists face similar challenges when communicating urgent crises like climate change. Many struggle to break through misinformation, media bias, and political agendas. The film exaggerates some aspects but captures the frustration scientists feel when their warnings are ignored."

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Question to Kiara (Environmental Science Expert)**  
- "Kiara, *Don't Look Up* uses a comet as an allegory for climate change. How well does this metaphor represent the crisis we face today?"

---

### **Specialist 2 (Kiara, Environmental Science Expert)**  
**Climate Change & Urgency**  
- *[Slide 4: Climate Change Facts vs. Fiction in the Movie]*  
- "The comet metaphor is a powerful way to show the urgency of climate change. Unlike a comet impact, climate change is gradual, but its effects—wildfires, rising sea levels, extreme weather—are already happening. The movie highlights how delays in action can lead to catastrophic consequences."

---

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**  
**Public Vote: Who should be responsible?**  
- "Let’s take a quick vote! Who do you think holds the most responsibility for tackling climate change?  
1. Governments  
2. Corporations  
3. Individuals  
4. Scientists  
- *[Pause for audience vote & discuss results]*"

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Question to Yacine (Space Exploration Expert)**  
- "Yacine, the film suggests that technology and space colonization could be a last resort. Is escaping to another planet really a viable solution?"

---

### **Specialist 3 (Yacine, Space Exploration Expert)**  
**Space as a Solution?**  
- *[Slide 5: Space Colonization Challenges]*  
- "While space exploration is advancing, colonizing another planet is not a short-term solution. Issues like radiation exposure, resource scarcity, and the immense costs make it unrealistic. Instead of seeking an escape, we should focus on preserving Earth."

---

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**  
**Expert Debate**  
- "Now, let’s make this more engaging! Kiara, do you agree with Yacine, or do you think space exploration is a necessary backup plan?"

- *[Allow experts to discuss their viewpoints]*

---

### **Journalist 1 (Mathilde)**  
**Conclusion & Public Reflection**  
- "To wrap up, *Don't Look Up* reminds us of the importance of listening to science and taking action before it's too late. The question remains: Will we act in time?"

---

### **Journalist 2 (Oriol)**  
**Quiz Time!**  
- *[Slide 6: Quiz Questions]*  
- "Before we end, let’s test your knowledge! *[Ask audience 3-4 questions related to the film and environmental science]*"

---

### **End of Presentation**  
- "Thank you for your attention! Let’s keep the conversation going and take action for our planet."
