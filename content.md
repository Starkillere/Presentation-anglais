### **Scientific Aspects (Speaker 2 - 3 minutes)**

- **Time Dilation & Relativity**:
  - Explain how the film realistically portrays time dilation near a black hole.
  - Mention Einstein’s General Relativity and gravitational time dilation.
- **Wormholes**:
  - Explain the concept of wormholes as a theoretical possibility.
  - How the Einstein-Rosen Bridge is depicted in the movie.
- **Black Holes**:
  - Describe Gargantua’s visual accuracy, created using real physics simulations.
  - How Kip Thorne’s equations helped generate the CGI.

### **Pseudo-Science (Speaker 3 - 3 minutes)**

- **The Fifth Dimension & Tesseract**:
  - Explain the concept of a five-dimensional space.
  - How Cooper's experience in the tesseract is speculative.
- **Love as a Physical Force**:
  - Analyze the idea of love transcending dimensions.
  - Why it is more a philosophical theme than a scientific fact.
- **Communication through Gravity**:
  - Discuss the Morse code in the watch scene.
  - The questionable scientific feasibility of this mechanism.

### **Scientific Inconsistencies (Speaker 4 - 2 minutes)**

- **The Water Planet’s Extreme Time Dilation**:
  - Explain why the 1-hour = 7 years ratio is exaggerated.
- **Survival in a Black Hole**:
  - Discuss the impossibility of Cooper surviving the event horizon.
- **The Ending & Cooper’s Return**:
  - Explain why being ejected from the black hole is unlikely.

### **Conclusion & Quiz (All Speakers - 1 minute)**

- **Summary**:
  - Science in *Interstellar* is impressive but has speculative elements.
  - Kip Thorne ensured realism, but creative liberties were taken.
- **Quiz Questions**:
  1. What scientific theory is crucial to the plot?
  2. What is the most significant scientific inaccuracy?
  3. How was Gargantua’s black hole visualization created?
- **Closing words & Thanks**
