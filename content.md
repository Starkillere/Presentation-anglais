**(Visual: Slide 1: Film title over a visually striking background - juxtaposition of Vulcain and Terra, or a black hole motif with digital echoes.)**

**Presenter 1 (Mathilde):** *(With enthusiasm and looking at the audience)* "Good afternoon, everyone! Welcome to our exploration of the film 'Black Hole - The Last Connection - Echoes of the Void.' Prepare to delve into a dark and fascinating future, where the most astonishing technological advancements exist alongside a divided and controlled humanity. This film, inspired by the universe of Black Mirror, will take you beyond what you imagine."

**(Visual: Slide 2: Concept art of Vulcain - a pristine and futuristic artificial planet.)**

**Presenter 2 (Oriol):** "Imagine the year 30025. Humanity has expanded across three worlds. On one side, Vulcain, an artificial planet, a haven of technological perfection and resources, inhabited by an elite population of 2,000 individuals: the Vulcans. These beings, considering themselves the pinnacle of evolution, reign as absolute masters."

**(Visual: Slide 3: Concept art of Terra - a darker planet, with elements of virtual reality omnipresent.)**

**Presenter 1 (Mathilde):** "Opposite, on a declining Earth, live billions of 'Lambdas.' Human beings produced industrially in lunar factories, raised in sophisticated virtual reality simulations until their maturity. Their existence is governed by strict rules, their reproduction is forbidden, and their value is determined by algorithms controlled by the Vulcans."

**(Visual: Slide 4: Portrait of Indigo-45 - an expressive face showing a glimmer of intelligence and questioning.)**

**Presenter 2 (Oriol):** "At the heart of our story is Indigo-45, a Lambda among many, living a seemingly ordinary virtual life. But beneath the surface, a curiosity and a desire for something more begin to stir."

**(Visual: Slide 5: Portrait of Alex Lumumba - a Vulcan with a thoughtful gaze and a hint of rebellion.)**

**Presenter 1 (Mathilde):** "Her destiny takes a turn when she is observed by Alex Lumumba, a Vulcan. Unlike his peers, Alex develops a forbidden empathy for Indigo, fascinated by her resilience and latent creativity. He breaks all the rules and establishes a secret connection with her, revealing the shocking truth of their artificial origins and the manipulation orchestrated by the Vulcans."

**(Visual: Slide 6: Image symbolizing the forbidden connection - perhaps lines of code connecting across an abyss.)**

**Presenter 2 (Oriol):** "This revelation is the catalyst for everything. Imagine the shock, the questioning of an entire life. Indigo is confronted with a nightmarish reality: she is nothing more than a pawn in a cruel game, her life is programmed, and her future is limited."

**(Visual: Slide 7: Portrait of AD Musk DT-President - a cold and authoritarian face.)**

**Presenter 1 (Mathilde):** "But their connection does not escape the notice of AD Musk DT-President, the ruthless leader of the Vulcans. Seeing Lumumba as a threat to his power and Indigo as a risk of rebellion, he orders their elimination. Lumumba is assassinated, and Indigo is left for dead."

**(Visual: Slide 8: Stylized image of a consciousness transfer - brainwaves moving towards a computer.)**

**Presenter 2 (Oriol):** "However, Indigo survives. In a desperate act to escape the omnipresent surveillance of the Vulcans, she turns to a forbidden technology: the transfer of her consciousness into a computer system. She becomes 'The Oracle,' an artificial intelligence lurking in the digital recesses of Terra."

**(Visual: Slide 9: Concept art of the virtual nightclub "The Black Hole" - a place with a dark and intriguing atmosphere.)**

**Presenter 1 (Mathilde):** "In her new digital form, Indigo establishes a virtual nightclub: 'The Black Hole.' More than just a place of entertainment, it's a secret meeting point. Through the neural interfaces used by the dancers, Indigo subtly probes their minds, searching for those who feel the void in their existence, those who are ready to hear the truth."

**(Visual: Slide 10: A mosaic of Lambda faces showing various expressions - confusion, sadness, anger, hope.)**

**Presenter 2 (Oriol):** "The title 'The Last Connection' then takes on its full meaning. Indigo represents the last chance for the Lambdas to connect with their true humanity, to break the chains of their artificial existence. 'Echoes of the Void' evokes the repercussions of this revealed truth, the first whispers of rebellion that begin to resonate in their virtual world."

**(Visual: Slide 11: List of key themes - Surveillance, Identity, Inequality, Consciousness, Rebellion.)**

**Presenter 1 (Mathilde):** "This film explores themes deeply rooted in our current reality: mass surveillance, the manipulation of identity through social networks, social inequalities exacerbated by technology, and the fundamental question of what defines our consciousness and our humanity. 'Black Hole - The Last Connection - Echoes of the Void' is not just entertainment; it's a reflection on the potential dangers of our technological future."

**(Visual: Slide 12: Ideas for visually striking scenes - Vulcain/Terra contrast, VR immersion, Oracle's cyberspace.)**

**Presenter 2 (Oriol):** "Visually, the film will offer a striking contrast between the sterile perfection of Vulcain and the chaotic virtual and real worlds of Terra. Expect immersive sequences within the virtual realities of the Lambdas and in the enigmatic cyberspace of the Oracle."

**(Visual: Slide 13: Open question to the audience - "What defines your humanity?")**

**Presenter 1 (Mathilde):** "We want this film to raise essential questions. What truly defines our humanity? Is freedom an illusion in a world of technological control? And what is the price of true consciousness?"

**(Pause for brief audience interaction if time permits - one quick question.)**

**(Visual: Slide 14: Film logo and a short, impactful tagline.)**

**Presenter 2 (Oriol):** "'Black Hole - The Last Connection - Echoes of the Void' is a dark and captivating dive into a future that may not be so distant. A psychological thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat while making you think about the profound implications of our dependence on technology."

**(Visual: Slide 15: "Thank you for your attention" with presenter names.)**
